<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">GOV.UK Forms 如何運作的</h1>
<p>
  GOV.UK Forms 是一個讓您可以在GOV.UK上輕鬆建立線上表單的全新平台。這個平台目前正和少數的政府夥伴合作開發中。
</p>

</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Creating a form using GOV.UK Forms</h2>

<p>
  You need to be given access to GOV.UK Forms to use it. In this early stage of development, we’re only working with a limited number of government teams.
</p>

<p>These are the steps to make a form with GOV.UK Forms.</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Create a form and give the form a name.</li>
  <li>When people complete and submit the form, the information they enter will be sent in the body of an email to the email address you specified.</li>
  <li>
    請提供隱私條款，以及表單完成後要寄送的電子郵件，並填寫使用者完成表單後的說明。
  </li>
  <li>Make the form live.</li>
  <li>
    在 GOV.UK 發佈此表單的連結並附上使用者在完成此表單前需要檢閱的任何須知。
  </li>
  <li>
    當使用者完成此表單，他們在表單中輸入的資訊，會傳送到您指定的電子郵件中。
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Features available now</h2>
<p>
  During this early phase of development, we’re focusing on the simplest and most commonly needed form features first.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Create simple questions</h3>

<p>You can create questions to ask for:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a short text answer</li>
  <li>a long text answer</li>
  <li>a date</li>
  <li>a UK address</li>
  <li>a National Insurance number</li>
  <li>a phone number</li>
  <li>電子郵件</li>
  <li>make a question optional</li>
  <li>a selection of one or more answers from a list of options</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When people complete the form, their responses will be validated to make sure they’re in the correct format. 
</p>

<p>You can also:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>add a hint to a question to help people answer it</li>
  <li>make a question optional</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Forms use GOV.UK Design System styles, components and patterns
</h3>

<p>
  使用經過測試與容易使用的設計，意味著您無須擔心表單的視覺與介面設計。這部分將會與 GOV.UK 自動維持一致。
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Provide privacy information</h3>

<p>
  To comply with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), you’ll need to provide a link to privacy information for the people who’ll enter their data into your form.
</p>

<p>
  The privacy information needs to include your purposes for collecting the data, and how you'll manage the data. You may already publish this information, for example in a privacy notice or personal information charter.
</p>

<p>
  A link to the privacy information will be added to the footer of your form.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">設定電子郵件以接收完成的表單</h3>

<p>
  每個表單都需要設定一個電子郵件，當表單完成後將結果寄到此信箱。表單的結果會顯示在電子郵件的內容中。
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  People can check their answers before they submit a form
</h3>

<p>
  People will be shown a summary page when they have answered all the questions in a form. They will be able to review and check their answers before they submit the form. This will help to avoid errors or missing information.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Add a declaration for people to agree to
</h3>

<p>
  You can add a declaration that people must confirm they understand and agree to before they submit their completed form. 
</p>

<p>
  You might want to add a declaration if, for example, you need people to confirm they have provided accurate information, or that they understand the consequences of providing false information.
</p>  

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Tell people what will happen next</h3>

<p>
  Content you add about what will happen after the form is submitted will be shown on a confirmation page when someone submits a form. This will help to set their expectations and avoid unnecessary contact.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Provide contact information for people to get help
</h3>

<p>
  請您至少提供一個方式，讓填寫表單的使用者遇到問題時能夠聯繫您。聯繫方式可以是電子郵件、電話號碼或是線上連結。
</p>

<p>
  The contact information will be displayed at the bottom of every page of the form. This will help people to use your form successfully, and will let you know if there are any problems with your form.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Features we’re working on next</h2>

<p>我們正在（和即將）要處理的功能：</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Enabling autofill for questions that ask for certain types of personal information - to make it easier for people to answer those questions</li>
  <li>Simple logic to skip questions based on a response</li>
  <li>Draft functionality - so forms can be edited without affecting the live version until the changes are ready to be made live</li>
  <li>User management and permissions to control what users can and cannot do</li>
  <li>The ability to add longer guidance for more complex questions</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Updates</h2>

<p>
  We’re still in the early stages of development so our plans may change. We’ll update this page when this happens and add more detail when we can.

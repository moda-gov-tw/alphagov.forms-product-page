</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Creating a form using GOV.UK Forms</h2>

<p>
  You need to be given access to GOV.UK Forms to use it. In this early stage of development, we’re only working with a limited number of government teams.
</p>

<p>These are the steps to make a form with GOV.UK Forms.</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Create a form and give the form a name.</li>
  <li>When people complete and submit the form, the information they enter will be sent in the body of an email to the email address you specified.</li>
  <li>
    Provide privacy information, the email address you want completed forms to be sent to, and details about what will happen after a form is submitted.
  </li>
  <li>Make the form live.</li>
  <li>
    Publish a link to the form on GOV.UK along with any guidance people need to read before they complete the form.
  </li>
  <li>
    When people complete and submit the form, the information they enter will be sent in the body of an email to the email address you specified.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Features available now</h2>
<p>
  During this early phase of development, we’re focusing on the simplest and most commonly needed form features first.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Create simple questions</h3>

<p>You can create questions to ask for:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a short text answer</li>
  <li>a long text answer</li>
  <li>a date</li>
  <li>a UK address</li>
  <li>a National Insurance number</li>
  <li>a phone number</li>
  <li>add a hint to a question to help people answer it</li>
  <li>make a question optional</li>
  <li>a selection of one or more answers from a list of options</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When people complete the form, their responses will be validated to make sure they’re in the correct format. 
</p>

<p>You can also:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>add a hint to a question to help people answer it</li>
  <li>make a question optional</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Forms use GOV.UK Design System styles, components and patterns
</h3>

<p>
  Using these tested and accessible designs means you do not have to worry about the visual and interface design of your forms. And they’ll automatically look consistent with GOV.UK.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Provide privacy information</h3>

<p>
  To comply with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), you’ll need to provide a link to privacy information for the people who’ll enter their data into your form.
</p>

<p>
  The privacy information needs to include your purposes for collecting the data, and how you'll manage the data. You may already publish this information, for example in a privacy notice or personal information charter.
</p>

<p>
  A link to the privacy information will be added to the footer of your form.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Set the email address for completed forms</h3>

<p>
  Each form needs an email address to be set for completed forms to be sent to when they’re submitted. Data from completed forms will be sent to this email address in the body of an email.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  People can check their answers before they submit a form
</h3>

<p>
  People will be shown a summary page when they have answered all the questions in a form. They will be able to review and check their answers before they submit the form. This will help to avoid errors or missing information.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Add a declaration for people to agree to
</h3>

<p>
  You can add a declaration that people must confirm they understand and agree to before they submit their completed form. 
</p>

<p>
  You might want to add a declaration if, for example, you need people to confirm they have provided accurate information, or that they understand the consequences of providing false information.
</p>  

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Tell people what will happen next</h3>

<p>
  Content you add about what will happen after the form is submitted will be shown on a confirmation page when someone submits a form. This will help to set their expectations and avoid unnecessary contact.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Provide contact information for people to get help
</h3>

<p>
  You must provide at least one way for people to get help if they get stuck while filling in your form. It can be an email address, phone number or a link to online help.
</p>

<p>
  聯絡資訊會顯示在每一頁表單的底部。這能夠幫助使用者成功地使用您的表單，也能了解您的表單是否有未注意到的缺失。
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Features we’re working on next</h2>

<p>These are the features we’re working on now and next:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Enabling autofill for questions that ask for certain types of personal information - to make it easier for people to answer those questions</li>
  <li>Simple logic to skip questions based on a response</li>
  <li>有效率地使用草稿功能 - 這樣您既可以編輯表單，又不會影響已經上線的版本，直到您確認所有的變動，新版本才會上線</li>
  <li>User management and permissions to control what users can and cannot do</li>
  <li>The ability to add longer guidance for more complex questions</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Updates</h2>

<p>
  We’re still in the early stages of development so our plans may change. We’ll update this page when this happens and add more detail when we can.

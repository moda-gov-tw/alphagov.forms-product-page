<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">隱私公告：我們如何使用您的資料</h1>

<p>最後更新：2022年9月16日</p>

<p>
  GOV.UK Forms 讓英國政府的團隊能夠建立線上表單，以收集個人或機構的資訊。
</p>

<p>
  GOV.UK Forms is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS) which is part of the Cabinet Office.
</p>

<p>
  Organisations that create online forms using GOV.UK Forms are the data controller of personal data they collect using those forms, whilst the Cabinet Office, through GDS, is the data processor. The data controller must tell you about what they are doing with your personal data.
</p>

<p>
  This privacy notice explains what personal data the Cabinet Office collects and processes as a data controller through the GOV.UK Forms website and platform.
</p>

<p>
  Read <a href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053">the Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register</a> for more information.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Data we collect from you and what we do with it</h2>

<p>
  When you use the GOV.UK Forms service your device sends information such as your:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>IP 位址</li>
  <li>web browser and version number</li>
  <li>time zone and language settings</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>give you the information and web pages you request</li>
  <li>monitor the use of the site for security threats</li>
  <li>
    monitor the performance of the site to identify inefficiencies and JavaScript errors
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We collect this information in system logs. These logs are stored in Amazon Web Services in Ireland.
</p>
<p>
  We move some of this information to our security and network monitoring tools in Ireland and the USA which are provided by companies acting as our data processors.
</p>

<p>
  We may also use this information to produce anonymised reports about the GOV.UK Forms service. This helps us understand where we can make improvements. We may share this information with the data controller of the form.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re a public sector employee and you request a GOV.UK Forms account we’ll collect your:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>name</li>
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We use this data to ensure that only legitimate users of GOV.UK Forms can use it to create forms.
</p>

<p>
